                About Me.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                Hello. I am Charlie.<br />
                I'm from Victoria, Australia and currently live in New South Wales, Australia. I am 24 years old. I moved to New South Wales because I currently work within the Department of Defence and I am moving state every few years. I have lived in every major city on the East coast, Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, and Hobart. <br />
                I always get asked, "What is the best city?" or "Which is your favourite city to live in?"<br/>
                I think the answer to this is simple, every city has its own lifestyle, and the only way to answer that question is to experience it for yourself. I think every place in Australia sits on an even level, and every person within the country is individually fantastic - making every city individually fantastic.<br />
                I speak English and Swedish, but my Swedish is very poor since I haven't used it for over 8 years. I intend on learning another language, but I am currently stumped by the idea of do I learn what I'm interested in; Italian, or do I learn what would be more useful; Mandarin.<br />
                Additionally, you may have noticed, I love learning new things and excelling. I try to put 100% into everything I do. The brain was made to be used; why waste the opportunity we have?
            </div>

        <div class="Interest">
            <h2>Interest</h2>
            <div class="title">
                What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                My interest in IT started when I was young and I first saw my dad doing work on his computer at home. Stragely, he made a PowerPoint presentation for his work, and after that I made "games" on PowerPoint. How? It was through the action of 'clicking' on a certain object would take you to a certain slide. The first game I made was very similar to duck hunt. You would click on circles hiding behind the bushes and they would disappear until they were all gone.<br />
                I have been working in the IT industry for the past 5 years, doing a multitude of jobs, Network support, LAN administration, application management. However, I intend on completing my degree so I can get recognised into a software development role.

                Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                I chose to come to RMIT since my brother had tried to go through Swinburne University for IT, and they were incredibly poor. I previously tried Universities in NSW, since that is currently where I live, but they were poor with responding to my enquiries. RMIT is in Melbourne, where I'm originally from, and seemed to be likely the most reliable Univesity I could rely on for education in the field of IT.

                I expect to fill any gaps I have in the field, and that I will learn more about industry standards such as Slack, GitHub. And I will learn technical faults and resolutions for programs and networks.

            <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
            <div>
                <div class="inset">
                    <a href="dj.png">PNG Link</a><br/>

                My <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/59411254?type=standout#sol=cf81e61ba15fb5a8f3662be0c971b79e933fefb7">dream job</a>, I believe, is rather simple.<br/>
                The main interests to me: Dedicated parking spot, and flexible working hours including working from home. As my main work experience lies in the Department of Defence, I have never had benefits like these. Obviously, benefits is something I will need to look more into in the future, however I believe these are simple sets to advertise a little further.<br/>
                I am also appealed to the programming side of IT, and I enjoy performance optimisation and debugging of programs. This I believe is a job which is out of reach in my graduating years, though a goal to strive for.<br /> 
            </div>
            <div class="title">
                A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                This position is appeal since it is working within a non-IT centric industry. So, I believe that a workplace in a cyber-security firm would not appeal to me. This is purely just because of the personalities within the workplace are not varied. I believe that personally, I find other characters and personalities interesting. If I work within an industry with contact with people within my own work role, then I may get bored or disinterested in the environment.<br/>
                Another appealing aspect is the modern work-from-home opportunity. Though it may not be every day that work from home is guaranteed, I believe it increases your work life balance increadibly to not need to spend over an hour driving to and from work.<br/>
            </div>
            <div class="title">
                A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                The skills required to be able to do this job is primarily a programming examination. C++ is the language which they use (industry standard).<br/>
                The other skills, object orientated design, debugging skills, I believe are requirements within knowing a programming language. Object Orientated design is the way which you program C++, and debugging is the only way to learn a programming language - by making mistakes and fixing them.<br/>
                Verbal and written communication skills come with practice and exposure to talking with non-technical personnel, or technical personnel. Therefore, this job would not be a starting point for a career in the software development industry.
            </div>
            <div class="title">
                A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                I have skills of other programming langauges, such as Python, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, TypeScript, Powershell, etc. Therefore, I believe it'll take a few months to get used to C++ programming.<br />
                Though, I believe I would not yet have the communication skills to jump into a senior, or non-junior position in a company within a software development industry. Communicating complicated ideas to my team or to non-technical shareholders is a skill which I am still practicing.<br/>
                Being working in the IT industry for already 5 years, I believe I may be able to apply and be considered for a position, though I do not have the self confidence to be able to jump into a complex role in another facet of IT.
            </div>
            <div class="title">
                A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                I have not been practicing programming for the past 3 years, I would estimate. So my first step is to increase my technical skill, and then the step after that I believe would be to contact technical personnel within the industry and gain a higher level of skill describing complex issues to like-minded people.

                    Advocates (INFJs) may be the rarest personality type of all, but they certainly leave their mark on the world. Idealistic and principled, they aren’t content to coast through life – they want to stand up and make a difference. For Advocate personalities, success doesn’t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and being a force for good in the world.<br/>
                    While they have lofty goals and ambitions, Advocates shouldn’t be mistaken for idle dreamers. People with this personality type care about integrity, and they’re rarely satisfied until they’ve done what they know to be right. Conscientious to the core, they move through life with a clear sense of their values, and they aim never to lose sight of what truly matters – not according to other people or society at large, but according to their own wisdom and intuition.

                Psychological generalisations, such as these quizzes, can give someone a sense of belonging to something greater. As a general idea, they allow you to fit into a society of rules - the modern world. Do I believe these results hold a greater bearing on my life? I believe these results bare what you are today, and that you have every opportunity to change yourself to who you want to be. They do not tell you how to improve to be the person you want to be. You will, no matter who you are, find a place of belonging into society and fall into place.<br/>
                However, I did mention these results are a good metric for who you are currently - they assess and generalise your answers. This can be useful for an employer to assess "will this <i>current</i> person fit into my <i>current</i> team?" That being said, I believe that my behaviour is very passive and accepting of change. In terms of an office environment, I will never stray away from an interesting conversation. I believe that this level of extraversion - not much, but enough - creates a good mix of a willingness to work, and a willingness to distractions for an employer or team. My team effort is high, but I'm always open to the way people want to change things to improve, because without change we would have never made the wheel in the first place. The risks that my personality poses on the formation of a team is that I will often will not lead a team into victory, but I will assist the team to get to victory from the backlines. Without a good leader on the team, I am a lost backbencher. This is something I strive to improve in my career and life, so I always will take humbly on the position of a leader.

                    In the slums of this megacity, billions of people live below the poverty line. They must break the rules to wake up tomorrow. On the streets, you can only be assured safety if you’re friends with the gangs. In this atmospheric world, you’ll be challenged every day with making non-ethical decisions to stay alive, slowly diving deeper into the underworld or trying to escape, to the higher heights. Betray your origins, or ruthlessly accept it?

                <p>
                    Technologies being worked on will be procedural animation techniques. By applying “wanted positions” rather than absolute positions in a standard animation. Fewer things will be needed to animate and create a more fluid result. This will make animating climbing up walls and unnatural structures more enjoyable than what is seen in games like Assassin’s Creed, which animate between points. The method of this will include adding restrictions to movement, so while climbing through something the character will not be going through the ceiling.<br/>
                    Another factor will be adding “states,” where the character will move between. For example, stepping will move the legs between states, and the arms may remain in a single state and be affected by the hip movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another major technology which will be worked on is rain and how it will interact with the environment of the world. The intention is to make portions of the world able to flood and will require the user to wait to continue. However, waiting will not be numbing where you will have nothing else to do, but you will be able to complete other objective which may achieve the original goal. The rain physics will be cloud based, which will be aimed to be as real feeling as possible. The cloud development will start as at a point and expand until it meets a dew point and will rain. This will also affect the fog which the camera will experience. With a poorly designed city comes bad drainage. This is something I witness in particular areas of Sydney during major storms, however the intention is to exaggerate it so much it gives an additional feeling of disgust for the landscape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this idea, it will be required to create a system where the quests, goals, or objectives able to be achieved through multiple methods. Much like if you require a stapler, you don’t need to go to certain Woolworths store, but you can go to nearly any store. The primary objective is not to create a game which is easy to complete, or easy to speed-run, or, as a matter of fact, even enjoyable. The main objective is to experiment with technologies and ideas and create a realistic feel of the world – without compromising too much enjoyment for realism (ARMA series).

                The software required to complete this will be Microsoft Visual Studio, utilising C# programming and the Unity3D engine. Hardware will be limited to graphics components capable of DirectX 12.<br/>
                Unity3D runs modern graphics techniques through DirectX 12 technologies. Therefore, the primary learning goal of shaders/graphics will require DX12. Unity also runs through C#, and all libraries/code bases are going to be self-sourced. This is excluding the default packages within Unity, such as ShaderLab. Outsourcing libraries is useful, however, only until the extent of wanting to complete work efficiently, and I as a learning journey I am looking forward to fault finding every individual bug and error that’s encountered.

                There will be a large amount of software written to create this project entirely, and a lot of design aspects in the second half stage. The largest code will likely be the procedural animation since it will be code-driven animation. The more challenge is testing whether the codes feel natural and normal, so I will need to get someone external to play-test the project and feedback advice on possible improvements. The plan of this project is to be completely self-written excluding the engine itself, so it will take a long duration and possibly only one major technology will be completed by 3 months time.

                As previously mentioned, this project is primarily for learning and experimentation. With the factors of learning and experimentation, a major contribution this will make to my professional life is that it will be able to add to a portolio, as this webpage template may be one day. Learning graphic technologies is enjoyable, and I have recently been inspired by the artist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sakurarabbit6708">Sakura Rabbit</a>, and that they have recently been featured by the developers of Unity. My goal is to create new and interesting things, and become a master of my trade.
